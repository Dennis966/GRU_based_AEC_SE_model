# AEC_SE_model (GRU)

## A GRU based Autoencoder Speech Enhancement Model.

I've replaced the SRU units with GRU units. Since I had problems importing SRU's, I commented out all the SRU-based models in build.py and declared my new models in 'main.py'

### SE model

* Model Name: First_SE_model
* Structure: 4 GRU layers

### AEC model

* Model Name: First_AEC_model
* Structure: 4 GRU layers

### SE_fixAEC model
